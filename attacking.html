		<ul><span class="tip-header">Clan Castles</span>
		</br>
	</br>
			<li>Always, regardless of doing a regular attack or war attack, clear the enemy units Clan Castle (CC). If you do not do this, you can almost gaurantee your attack will fail.</li>
			<li>In a war, you can view the persons base before attacking. Click on their CC to view the range at which their units can be pulled out.</li>
			<li>To pull the Clan Castle troops out, if possible, use small and cheap units such as Barbarians. If their CC radius is covered by buildings but not walls, drop a giant or two in an area where they will walk towards a defensive structure and therefore, into the CC radius. If their CC radius is surrounded by walls, drop in a hog or 2.</li>
			<li>After all the CC units have emerged, pull them to the side you want to launch your main offensive on, this prevents you from wasting some troops.</li>
			<li>The best way to kill CC units is to groups their units and then surround them with "meat shields", aka Barbs. Then drop a couple wizards behind the barbs so they do not take damage. They will make quick work of grouped units.</li>
			<li>If killing a dragon or wizards, DO NOT drop all of your units in the same place, they will all die in one hit due to splash damage! Spread your units around so they only die one at a time.</li>
			<li>Don't use lightning... those troops are easy to kill and you can use that spell slot for a much more needed heal or rage.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul><span class="tip-header">Traps</span>
		</br>
	</br>
			<li>Try and identify where traps are. Giant Bombs are commonly placed in area's where their "white space" is very narrow. Ie. A building on both side and one square strip leading to their base. Drop Barbs or Goblins to try and trip the traps first.</li>
			<li>Walls with one space open in a path from one defensive structure to another is most gauranteed to be a spring trap. If you can, attack from a different area and leave that section for last.</li>
			<li>If they have defensive structures that lure your giants towards an open section in front of those structures, there is most likely a spring trap there. Drop a giant near that area and then a couple wall breakers to create a different route.</li>

		</ul>	
		
		<ul><span class="tip-header">Stars in Wars</span>
		</br>
	</br>	
			<li>Getting one star against an opponent in a war cannot always be helped but it causes someone else to have to use an attack to "clean up" that person. If you think you can only one star a person, find someone else to attack.</li>
			<li>There is a completely different strategy in trying to go for 3 stars on someone vs 2 stars. Often, going for 100% can lead to only getting 1 star. It may be better to target the persons Townhall (TH), almost ensuring you to get 2 stars.</li>
			<li>If we are fighting a tough clan, it is perfectly okay to attack lower. We can then gaurantee we get more stars and we have enough people to clear the majority of their players. Our lower guys can always go for loot attack on 3 starred low guys if need be.</li>

		</ul>

		<ul><span class="tip-header">PRACTICE!</span>
		</br>
	</br>
			<li>Regardless of being inexperienced in attacking or being a potential "expert", you can never have enough practice attacking! If you suck at attacking, practice on regular attacks. Try new things and see what happens when you do. Watch some videos of high level and people your level attacking whether it's our war replays or on youtube. If you can't attack well, we will not win wars and you will therefore not get that yummy yummy loot.</li>
